# Proteomics_Challenge
A script to find the position of each modified amino acid residue (see input.tsv) from a fasta file (see proteins.fasta)


Exercise 1: How to run?
=> python <space> sc.py <space> input.tsv <space> proteins.fasta <space> (any output file name)
an output with a successful run attached as 'checkout' file.

Exercise 2: Solution is a Python notebook attached as an HTML article and .ipynb file.
